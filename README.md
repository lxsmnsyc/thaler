> Isomorphic server-side functions

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/thaler.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thaler) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Install

```bash
npm i thaler
```

```bash
yarn add thaler
```

```bash
pnpm add thaler
```

## What?

`thaler` allows you to produce isomorphic functions that only runs on the server-side. This is usually ideal if you want to do server-side operations (e.g. database, files, etc.) on the client-side but without adding more abstractions such as defining extra REST endpoints, creating client-side utilities to communicate with the exact endpoint etc.

Another biggest benefit of this is that, not only it is great for isomorphic fullstack apps (i.e. metaframeworks like NextJS, SolidStart, etc.), if you're using TypeScript, type inference is also consistent too, so no need for extra work to manually wire-in types for both server and client.

## Functions

### `server$`

`server$` is the simplest of the `thaler` functions, it receives a callback for processing server [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and returns a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

The returned function can then accept request options (which is the second parameter for the `Request` object), you can also check out [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)

```js
import { server$ } from 'thaler';

const getMessage = server$(async (request) => {
  const { greeting, receiver } = await request.json();

  return new Response(`${greeting}, ${receiver}!`, {
    status: 200,
  });
});

// Usage
const response = await getMessage({
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    greeting: 'Hello',
    receiver: 'World',
  }),
});

console.log(await response.text()); // Hello, World!
```

### `get$`

Similar to `server$` except that it can receive an object that can be converted into query params. The object can have a string or an array of strings as its values.

Only `get$` can accept search parameters and uses the `GET` method, which makes it great for creating server-side logic that utilizes caching.

```js
import { get$ } from 'thaler';

const getMessage = get$(async ({ greeting, receiver }) => {
  return new Response(`${greeting}, ${receiver}!`, {
    status: 200,
  });
});

// Usage
const response = await getMessage({
  greeting: 'Hello',
  receiver: 'World',
});

console.log(await response.text()); // Hello, World!
```

You can also pass some request configuration (same as `server$`) as the second parameter for the function, however `get$` cannot have `method` or `body`. The callback in `get$` can also receive the `Request` instance as the second parameter.

```js
import { get$ } from 'thaler';

const getUser = get$((search, { request }) => {
  // do stuff
});

const user = await getUser(search, {
  headers: {
    // do some header stuff
  },
});
```

### `post$`

If `get$` is for `GET`, `post$` is for `POST`. Instead of query parameters, the object it receives is converted into form data, so the object can accept not only a string or an array of strings, but also a [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), a [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), or an array of either of those types.

Only `post$` can accept form data and uses the `POST` method, which makes it great for creating server-side logic when building forms.

```js
import { post$ } from 'thaler';

const addMessage = post$(async ({ greeting, receiver }) => {
  await db.messages.insert({ greeting, receiver });
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 200,
  });
});

// Usage
await addMessage({
  greeting: 'Hello',
  receiver: 'World',
});
```

You can also pass some request configuration (same as `server$`) as the second parameter for the function, however `post$` cannot have `method` or `body`. The callback in `post$` can also receive the `Request` instance as the second parameter.

```js
import { post$ } from 'thaler';

const addMessage = post$((formData, { request }) => {
  // do stuff
});

await addMessage(formData, {
  headers: {
    // do some header stuff
  },
});
```

### `fn$` and `pure$`

Unlike `get$` and `post$`, `fn$` and `pure$` uses a superior form of serialization, so that not only it supports valid JSON values, it supports [an extended range of JS values](https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval#supports).

```js
import { fn$ } from 'thaler';

const addUsers = fn$(async (users) => {
  const db = await import('./db');
  return Promise.all(users.map((user) => db.users.insert(user)));
});

await addUsers([
  { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@johndoe.com' },
  { name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane.doe@janedoe.com' },
]);
```

You can also pass some request configuration (same as `server$`) as the second parameter for the function, however `fn$` cannot have `method` or `body`. The callback in `fn$` can also receive the `Request` instance as the second parameter.

```js
import { fn$ } from 'thaler';

const addMessage = fn$((data, { request }) => {
  // do stuff
});

await addMessage(data, {
  headers: {
    // do some header stuff
  },
});
```

### `loader$` and `action$`

`loader$` and `action$` is like both `get$` and `post$` in the exception that `loader$` and `action$` can return any serializable value instead of `Response`, much like `fn$` and `pure$`

```js
import { action$, loader$ } from 'thaler';

const addMessage = action$(async ({ greeting, receiver }) => {
  await db.messages.insert({ greeting, receiver });
});

const getMessage = loader$(({ id }) => (
  db.messages.select(id)
));
```

## Closure Extraction

Other functions can capture server-side scope but unlike the other functions (including `pure$`), `fn$` has a special behavior: it can capture the client-side closure of where the function is declared on the client, serialize the captured closure and send it to the server.

```js
import { fn$ } from 'thaler';

const prefix = 'Message:';

const getMessage = fn$(({ greeting, receiver }) => {
  // `prefix` is captured and sent to the server
  return `${prefix} "${greeting}, ${receiver}!"`;
});

console.log(await getMessage({ greeting: 'Hello', receiver: 'World' })); // Message: "Hello, World!"
```

> **Note**
> `fn$` can only capture local scope, and not global scope. `fn$` will ignore top-level scopes.

> **Warning**
> Be careful on capturing scopes, as the captured variables must only be the values that can be serialized by `fn$`. If you're using a value that can't be serialized inside the callback that is declared outside, it cannot be captured by `fn$` and will lead to runtime errors.

## Modifying `Response`

`fn$`, `pure$`, `loader$` and `action$` doesn't return `Response` unlike `server$`, `get$` and `post$`, so there's no way to directly provide more `Response` information like headers.

As a workaround, these functions receive a `response` object alongside `request`.

```js
import { loader$ } from 'thaler';

const getMessage = loader$(({ greeting, receiver }, { response }) => {
  response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'max-age=86400');
  return `"${greeting}, ${receiver}!"`;
});
```

## Server Handler

To manage the server functions, `thaler/server` provides a function call `handleRequest`. This manages all the incoming client requests, which includes matching and running their respective server-side functions.

```js
import { handleRequest } from 'thaler/server';

const request = await handleRequest(request);
if (request) {
  // Request was matched
  return request;
}
// Do other stuff
```

Your server runtime must have the following Web API:

- [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)
- [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
- [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
- [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)
- [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)
  
Some polyfill recommendations:

- [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)
- [`node-fetch-native`](https://github.com/unjs/node-fetch-native)
- [`@remix-run/web-fetch`](https://github.com/remix-run/web-std-io/tree/main/packages/fetch)

## Intercepting Client Requests

`thaler/client` provides `interceptRequest` to intercept/transform outgoing requests made by the functions. This is useful for adding request fields like headers.

```js
import { interceptRequest } from 'thaler/client';

interceptRequest((request) => {
  return new Request(request, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
    },
  });
});

```

## Custom Server Functions

Thaler allows you to define your own server functions. It has to be provided through the `functions` config and has the following interface:

```js
// This is based on the unplugin integration
thaler.vite({
  functions: [
    {
      // Name of the function
      name: 'server$',
      // Boolean check if the function needs to perform
      // closure extraction
      scoping: false,
      // Target identifier (to be compiled)
      target: {
        // Name of the identifier
        name: 'server$',
        // Where it is imported
        source: 'thaler',
        // Kind of import (named or default)
        kind: 'named',
      },
      // Compiled function for the client
      client: {
        // Compiled function identifier
        name: '$$server',
        // Where it is imported
        source: 'thaler/client',
        // Kind of import
        kind: 'named',
      },
      // Compiled function for the server
      server: {
        // Compiled function identifier
        name: '$$server',
        // Where it is imported
        source: 'thaler/server',
        // Kind of import
        kind: 'named',
      },
    }
  ],
});
```

## `thaler/utils`

### `json(data, responseInit)`

A shortcut function to create a `Response` object with JSON body.

### `text(data, responseInit)`

A shortcut function to create a `Response` object with text body.

### `debounce(handler, options)`

Creates a debounced version of the async handler. A debounced handler will defer its function call until no calls have been made within the given timeframe.

Options:

- `key`: Required. A function that produces a unique string based on the arguments. This is used to map the function call to its timer.
- `timeout`: How long (in milliseconds) before a debounce call goes through. Defaults to `250`.

### `throttle(handler, options)`

Creates a throttled version of the async handler. A throttled handler calls once for every given timeframe.

Options:

- `key`: Required. A function that produces a unique string based on the arguments. This is used to map the function call to its timer.

### `retry(handler, options)`

Retries the `handler` when it throws an error until it resolves or the max retry count has been reached (in which case it will throw the final error). `retry` utilizes an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) process to gradually slow down the retry intervals.

- `interval`: The maximum interval for the exponential backoff. Initial interval starts at `10` ms and doubles every retry, up to the defined maximum interval. The default maximum interval is `5000` ms.
- `count`: The maximum number of retries. Default is `10`.

### `timeout(handler, ms)`

Attaches a timeout to the `handler`, that will throw if the `handler` fails to resolve before the given time.
